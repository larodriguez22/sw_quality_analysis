\chapter{Abstract}

Given the complexity of the environment and the interaction between the agent 
and the environment in \ac{RL} programs, developers face challenges in understanding 
the behavior of the agent and identifying bugs in the program. Speciffically, 
for bugs in which the program runs correctly, it is hard to understand the 
possible bug that is causing the agent to behave incorrectly. To address this 
problem, we propose \ac{Flik}, a back-in-time debugger for \ac{RL} programs.
\ac{Flik} is a console-based debugger that allows developers to interact with 
the program during execution, inspect the internal state of the agent, and modify 
its behavior in real-time.
