\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}

To evaluate and validate this tool as a framework for the quality development 
of RL programs, an initial empirical test is proposed with different scenarios 
that may arise in the development of RL programs. These scenarios range from 
the creation of an RL program from scratch to the process of optimizing 
learning parameters, aiming to determine the specific values to start with 
to achieve the most optimal convergence for the program.

Subsequently, an evaluation of the tool is proposed with a group of students 
from the RL course at the University of the Andes, in order to obtain 
feedback on the utility of the tool and potential improvements that can be made.
