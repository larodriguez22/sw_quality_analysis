\chapter{Analysis and Results}
\label{cha:results}
As said before the anonymized results are found at \href{https://uniandes-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/la_rodriguez_uniandes_edu_co/ESDy89Q-PgVBpYHEZ_CDh_IBhjhS35VFqNrlEjVw_ShY1w?e=0EBDBm&nav=MTVfezAwMDAwMDAwLTAwMDEtMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMH0}{this link}.
In this section the results of the survey presented in \fref{sec:evaluation} are presented and analyzed. This section 
is divided by the three main sections of the survey: \fref{sec:general-knowledge}, \fref{sec:tasks-results} and 
\fref{sec:usability}. Additionally, a discussion \fref{sec:discussion} section is added in which we analyze the results 
from the survey. The figures and complete tables that this section is referring to are found in \fref{sec:appendix-results}.

\section{General Knowledge Results}
\label{sec:general-knowledge}
Most of the people that answer the survey were very experienced on the use of python as it
can be seen in \fref{fig:exp-py}, most of the people had a level of expertise high (over 5)
as they used it very often in their work spaces and for the university tasks. Also, most of 
the people were very familiarized using \ac{RL} algorithms (\fref{fig:exp-rl}), as they were 
taking the course. This is very important information, as the bugs require previous knowledge
in \ac{RL} and python to be identified. Furthermore, the students were very familiarized with 
the terminal, this means it would be easy for them to interact with the tool, as the commands 
and the interface require experience using the console (\fref{fig:exp-terminal}). Nevertheless, 
the average of the 
students weren't familiarized with debuggers, and they only used them very rarely, or used 
Visual Studio Code interface simple features, like breakpoint function. This may lead to 
misunderstandings and probably difficulties in making the tasks, as the tool is based on
previous debugger (\fref{fig:exp-deb}).

\section{Tasks Results}
\label{sec:tasks-results}
As there can be seen in the following tables, most of the people made it through the first task (\fref{fig:task1}),
they thought it was an easy task to solve, relatively few time to complete the quest. This task 
was significantly hard because this was the task in which they were getting familiarized with the 
tool. The second task was harder than the first one, most of the people took longer to finish the 
task (\fref{fig:task2}), and most of the people had trouble finding the problem to the program. 



\section{Debugger Usability Results}
\label{sec:usability}

Regarding the debugger usability (\fref{tab:general1-debuggers} and \fref{tab:general2-debuggers}), it can be seen that the tool was useful to most of the people,
and the general comments were that the tool would be useful if there was more time to study it. 
And to learn about the tool before using it in real tasks. Most of the people thought that the 
tool was easy to use, once you get to know it a little better, and that most of the people would 
learn to use it quickly. Additionally, there were several comments about the tool improving the UI,
as it was hard to understand the tool at first sight, it wasn't similar to the Visual Studio Code 
interface that most of the people were used to use.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In general, the results of the survey were very positive, most of the people thought that 
the tool was useful specially for the kind of challenges \ac{RL} programs could have. In 
spite of the tool being hard to familiarized with, specially for the people who had very 
little experience with debuggers, most of the people thought that the tool was easy to use 
once you get to know it a little better. Additionally, people said that the tool would've 
been useful for the course, because of its capabilities to debug \ac{RL} programs.

Finally, in the following links there are two examples of the tool being used. In the first 
example, the tool is used to debug a simple program, this was used to introduced to the students 
the simple commands they could use like stepping (forward and backwards), modifying, or inspecting 
variables. In the second example, the tool is used to debug a \ac{RL} program, specially 
the gridworld example.
