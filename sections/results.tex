\chapter{Analysis and Results}
\label{cha:results}
As said before the anonymized results are found at \href{https://uniandes-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/la_rodriguez_uniandes_edu_co/ESDy89Q-PgVBpYHEZ_CDh_IBhjhS35VFqNrlEjVw_ShY1w?e=lm319K}{this link}.
In this section the results of the survey presented in \fref{sec:evaluation} are presented and analyzed. This section 
is divided by the three main sections of the survey: \fref{sec:general-knowledge}, \fref{sec:tasks-results} and 
\fref{sec:usability}. Additionally, a discussion \fref{sec:discussion} section is added in which we analyze the results 
from the survey.

\section{General Knowledge Results}
\label{sec:general-knowledge}
Most of the people that answer the survey were very experienced on the use of python, as they used it very often in 
their work spaces and for the university tasks. Also, most of the people were very familiarized using \ac{RL} algorithms,
as they were taking the course. Nevertheless, the avarage of the students weren't familiarized with 
debuggers, they only used one very rarely, or used Visual Studio code interface for debugging.

\section{Tasks Results}
\label{sec:tasks-results}

\section{Debugger Usability Results}
\label{sec:usability}

\section{Discussion}
